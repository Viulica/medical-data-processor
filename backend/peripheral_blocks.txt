In this field i need you to list out all blocks used here like this: |cpt_code;MD;Resident;CRNA;M1 modifier; M2 modifier|cpt_code;MD;Resident;CRNA;M1 modifier; M2 modifier|cpt_code;MD;Resident;CRNA;M1 modifier; M2 modifier you can list as many blocks as are used in the patient records, in order to place a block in your json output be very sure that the block was actually used on the patient (each block placed will have its own entire section with time of placement, people that took part in it and what laterality it was and what the type of the block was) there might be MULTIPLE though in one pdf obviously)

Modifiers: 59 (M1) + RT (M2) for right, LT + 59 for left, 50 + 59 for bilateral.

ERECTOR SPINAE PLANE (ESP) BLOCK

IF single injection (Unilateral): -> use 64466

IF continuous infusion catheter (Unilateral): -> use 64467

Modifiers: 59 (M1) + RT (M2) for right, LT + 59 for left.

IF single injection (Bilateral): -> use 64468 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

IF continuous infusion catheter (Bilateral): -> use 64469 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

TRANSVERSUS ABDOMINIS PLANE (TAP) BLOCK

IF Bilateral single shots: -> use 64488 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

IF Unilateral single shot: -> use 64486 (Modifiers: 59 in M1 + LT/RT in M2).

LATERAL FEMORAL CUTANEOUS NERVE (LFCN) BLOCK

IF single injection: -> use 64450

Modifiers: 59 (M1) + RT (M2) for right, LT + 59 for left, 50 + 59 for bilateral.

iPACK OR PENG BLOCK

Use code: 64473

Modifiers: 59 (M1) + RT (M2) for right, LT + 59 for left, 50 + 59 for bilateral.

NEURAXIAL (SPINAL/EPIDURAL) FOR POST-OP PAIN

Lumbar (L1-L5) Single Shot (Landmark): 62322 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

Lumbar (L1-L5) Single Shot (WITH Ultrasound): 62323 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

Cervical or Thoracic Single Shot: 62320 (Modifier: 59 in M1).

VASCULAR LINES

Arterial line (A-line): -> use 36620 (No modifiers).

Central venal catheter (CVP): -> use 36556 (No modifiers).

IF Pulmonary vein/artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterized: -> use 93503 (No modifiers).

SPECIAL RULE: ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE

IF Arterial line or CVP was ULTRASOUND guided: -> add another line with code 76937.

IF first line with US: No modifiers.

IF second or third line with US: Put 59 in M1.

(The 76937 line goes right after the A-line or CVP line it is indicated for).

FINAL FORMATTING RULES:

If anything is empty, put two semicolons ;; to indicate the section is empty.

NEVER put something in M2 but nothing in M1. It is sequential. 59 is always in M1.

Use same provider mapping strings as given; do not deviate.

If no blocks or lines were done, say: NONE DONE.
