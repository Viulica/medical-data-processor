TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 4 codes in ""ordered_codes""

TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:

TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 4 codes in ""ordered_codes""

ICD CODES TO ORDER:
M96.0, G70.01, E11.43, I25.10

TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 4 codes in ""ordered_codes""

2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 5 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 5 codes in ""ordered_codes""

Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""

ICD CODES TO ORDER:
R97.20, N18.6, I25.10, E11.9

TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 4 codes in ""ordered_codes""
3. Use the EXACT code strings provided above (preserve case and format)

2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 4 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:

2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""

You are a medical coding expert tasked with ordering ICD diagnosis codes by relevance to a surgical procedure.

PROCEDURE:
LAPAROSCOPIC RIGHT SALPINGECTOMY (Right: Abdomen)

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Post-op Diagnosis: Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy
Post-op Diagnosis - Coded: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy [O00.90]

ICD CODES TO ORDER:
O00.90, O00.1

TASK:
Reorder these ICD codes by relevance to the procedure, where:
1. ICD1 should be the PRIMARY diagnosis (the main reason for the procedure)
2. ICD2 is often also related to the procedure itself (but mostly not)
3. ICD3 and ICD4 should be ordered by decreasing relevance to the procedure

Consider:
- Which diagnosis is the primary reason the procedure was performed?
- Which diagnoses are directly related to the surgical intervention?
- Which diagnoses are secondary or comorbid conditions?

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    ""ordered_codes"": [""ICD1"", ""ICD2"", ""ICD3"", ""ICD4""],
    ""reasoning"": ""Brief explanation of why you ordered the codes this way, focusing on why the primary diagnosis was chosen.""
}

Where:
- ""ordered_codes"" contains all 2 codes in order of relevance (most relevant first)
- ""reasoning"" explains your decision-making process (1-3 sentences)

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no other text
2. Include ALL 2 codes in ""ordered_codes""
3. Use the EXACT code strings provided above (preserve case and format)
4. Your entire response must be parseable as JSON
