Rule of Combined Procedures:
Eye Procedures: When an 'Extracapsular Cataract Extraction' (which is typically code 142) is performed with a secondary glaucoma procedure (like a 'Goniotomy' or 'Microinvasive Glaucoma Procedure'), you MUST use the more comprehensive code 00140. Do not default to 00142.
Upper and Lower Endoscopies: If a 'Colonoscopy' is performed in the same session as an 'Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)' or 'Upper Endoscopy', you MUST use the combined code 00813. Do not code them separately.
Differentiate Screening vs. Diagnostic Colonoscopy:
Screening (Code 00812): Assign this code ONLY when the diagnosis explicitly states "screening," "history of polyps," or there are no symptoms listed.
Diagnostic (Code 00811): Assign this code when the diagnosis indicates a symptom, such as "abdominal pain," "hematochezia," "constipation," "change in bowel habit," or "hemorrhage."
Prioritize Maximum Specificity:
Always choose the most specific code available. For example, a 'Temporal Artery Biopsy' is always 00352, not a more general code.
For 'Pars Plana Vitrectomy', the correct code is 00145. Do not confuse it with other eye procedure codes.
Handle Multiple Procedures and Diagnoses:
Base your coding on the most significant or complex procedure listed.
For dental procedures involving multiple extractions, crowns, or rehabilitation under anesthesia, the correct code is almost always 00170. Do not be misled by the number of individual tasks performed.
For 'Bilateral Tonsillectomy' with or without an 'Adenoidectomy', the correct code is 00170.
Lesion and Biopsy Coding:
Excision of lesions on the eyelids (e.g., 'Chalazion', 'Cyst Resection', 'Carcinoma') should be coded as 00300. Do not use eyelid repair codes like 00103 for these procedures.
A 'Laryngoscopy with biopsy' is code 00320.
